# Bitburner
Steam link: [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/)
(Free) Game mimics a Unix enviroment, played Player vs. Enviroment. Bitburner is a programming-based incremental game. Write scripts in JavaScript to automate gameplay, learn skills, play minigames, solve puzzles, and more in this cyberpunk text-based incremental RPG.

The game uses Javascript as its main programming language. These first three scripts are either direct copy-pastes from the tutorial or slight modifications. There is going to be a lot of work left to do everything that I want to accomplish in-game.

These scripts were written in the in-game editor, you can just copy and paste the code into the in-game editor and save it.
